As part of my class 12 final project, I collaborated with two fellow students to develop a comprehensive Health and Fitness Application with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Our project aimed to promote a healthy lifestyle by providing users with valuable tools and information to monitor their health and make informed choices.

My primary responsibility in this project was the development of the login system, which played a crucial role in ensuring secure user access and data privacy. The login system featured a user-friendly interface and incorporated two authentication methods: password-based and OTP-based, allowing users to choose their preferred login method.

Once logged in, users were seamlessly redirected to the BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator window, which featured an attractive GUI and enabled users to quickly and easily check their BMI. Based on the calculated BMI, the application provided personalized recommendations, which further enhanced the user experience and engagement.

The application also included a dedicated section for health and fitness options, where users could access diet plans and a variety of exercising and yoga videos through web integration. This feature encouraged users to adopt a balanced approach to health and fitness, promoting a holistic well-being experience.

Our project was a testament to our commitment to harness technology for the betterment of individual health and well-being, all while delivering an exceptional user experience with a focus on aesthetics and functionality. I am proud of my contribution to the development of the login system, which played a pivotal role in ensuring the project's success and security.

TO run this project you need to set up MySQL and create a Database "meet" and need to set up pass as "admin123" and user as "root" inside the database create a table login with 3 fields:
1>Username(var char)
2>Password(var char)
3>gmail(var char)

Now you are set if you want to change the above name as I have specified you have to make changes in the code itself in def signup() and every where the mysql command are written
